> **v3.0.4** · `arbor diff` counts only the symbols your change edits, ranked by how many callers each has, and impact comes from callers alone. Rust calls on method receivers (`draft.run_started()`) resolve through the receiver's type, `arbor doctor` and the installers catch an older `arbor` hiding on PATH, and one-shot commands stay quiet.

## Why Arbor

Most AI coding tools treat code as text. Arbor builds a **semantic dependency graph** — functions, classes, and modules as nodes; calls, imports, and inheritance as edges — then answers execution-aware questions with deterministic precision:

| Question | Arbor answer |
|----------|--------------|
| *If I change this symbol, what breaks?* | Blast radius with depth, confidence, and risk level |
| *Who calls this — directly and transitively?* | Caller/callee traversal on the call graph |
| *What's the shortest path between A and B?* | A* path through real dependencies |
| *Is this PR too risky to merge?* | CI gate on blast-radius thresholds |

No keyword guessing. No embedding hallucinations. One graph, every interface.

Where the graph is *unsure*, it says so — edges carry a confidence, and ambiguous resolutions are labelled rather than hidden. An honest unknown beats a confident wrong answer.

---

## What's new in v3.0.4

A fix release, from a review that checked Arbor's answers on a real Tauri app
by hand. Every item ships with a regression test.

| Fix | What was wrong |
|-----|----------------|
| **`arbor diff` counts what you edited** | Editing a method also counted the class or `mod` around it, comment and attribute lines counted as code, and impact included everything the edited code calls. On a 3-file pull request with two edited functions, 3.0.3 reported 6 modified symbols and 58 impacted nodes; 3.0.4 reports 2 and 13. |
| **Named symbols** | The report gave counts only. `diff` and `check` now list each modified symbol with its file, line and caller count, most-called first. |
| **Rust method receivers** | `draft.run_started()` was dropped when several types defined `run_started`, so `arbor callers` showed none. The receiver's type is read from parameters, `let`s, `match` arms, fields and return types, across files. |
| **Shadowed installs** | An old `arbor` earlier on PATH silently answered instead of the new one. `arbor doctor` and the installers now say so and how to remove it. |
| **Quiet by default** | One-shot commands log warnings only; `-v` shows more. |
| **Older Linux** | Linux binaries need glibc 2.28, not 2.39. |

Also: clearer first-run errors, `arbor hook claude` never replaces a file it
can't read, MCP protocol fixes, origin checks on the WebSocket servers, and
signed provenance for every download. Cached graphs rebuild once on first use.

<details>
<summary><strong>v3.0.3</strong> (Rust calls through paths and macros, per-symbol diff, <code>--base</code>)</summary>

A fix release. Every item below was a wrong answer, not a missing feature, and
each ships with a regression test.

| Fix | What was wrong |
|-----|----------------|
| **Rust calls resolve** | `crate::jobs::enqueue()`, `Type::new()`, `self.helper()` and calls inside `assert!`/`format!` produced no edge, so heavily used Rust functions reported no callers. Paths now resolve through the module tree, and macro arguments are read as code. |
| **Per-symbol `arbor diff`** | Every symbol in a touched file counted as changed, so adding a function to a busy file reported that file's whole blast radius. New symbols now carry none; only modified ones do. Tests that call the change are listed as worth running, not counted as impact. |
| **`--base` and `--staged`** | `arbor diff`, `check` and `summary` saw only uncommitted edits unless `ARBOR_DIFF_BASE` was set. `--base origin/main` compares against the merge base, which is what a pull request shows; `--staged` checks just what is staged. |
| **Languages stay apart** | A TypeScript `enqueue` could be reported as a caller of a Rust `enqueue`. Resolution stays within a language family, and `callers`/`callees` list each same-named definition separately. |
| **No stale graphs** | After a branch switch, answers came from the old branch's graph when no remaining file was newer than it. The graph now records the commit it was built from and refreshes when `HEAD` moves. |
| **Inheritance edges** | `class Middle(Base)` produced no edge, so changing a base class showed zero blast radius. `extends`/`implements` edges are emitted and inherited methods stay reachable. |
| **Call cycles rank as one** | A closed ring of functions filled the top of every centrality ranking. Cycles are condensed before PageRank. |
| **HTTP bridge hardening** | `arbor bridge --http` accepted cross-origin and DNS-rebinding requests. It now checks `Origin`/`Host` and requires JSON bodies. |
| **Quieter bridge** | The bridge re-indexed ignored build directories in a busy loop. |

Also new: [`arbor receipt`](docs/RECEIPTS.md). After each coding-agent turn it
explains, in plain English, what changed and what was touched that you didn't
ask for, with `arbor receipt undo` to put a turn back.

Cached graphs from 3.0.0 are rebuilt automatically on first use.

<details>
<summary><strong>v3.0.0 — The Right Node</strong> (symbol resolution consults the importing file)</summary>

One fix, measured.

**Symbol resolution consults the importing file.** When a bare name matched
definitions in several modules, `resolve_ref` fell through to `SameDir` and
attached the edge to whichever definition sat in the caller's own directory —
not a dropped edge, a confidently misrouted one, stamped at 0.55 confidence.

`GraphBuilder` already kept a per-file import map, but only
`apply_import_validation` read it, and that scores an edge *after* one has been
chosen. It never saw the references going to the wrong node. Consulting it
between the same-file and same-directory checks keeps a local definition
shadowing an import, while letting a written import beat mere adjacency.
`Resolution::ViaImport` scores 0.93, above `SameDir`'s 0.55.

### Measured

A fixture of 260 modules across 10 layers, each layer defining the same 26
function names. Ground truth is derived from the generator's own edge list, so
the expected answer is exact rather than estimated.

| True downstream | v2.6.0 | v3.0.0 |
|---|---|---|
| 179 | 0 | **163** |
| 178 | 0 | **161** |
| 161 | 0 | **133** |
| 143 | 22 | **133** |
| 122 | 22 | **119** |
| 36 | 22 | 61 |
| 16 | 22 | 46 |

Previously flat at about 22 regardless of the real answer. Now it tracks. Risk
on the largest hub moves from `LOW` to `CRITICAL`.

Total edge count barely moves (1335 → 1334). That is the signature of
misrouting rather than loss: the edges were always there, pointing at the wrong
nodes.

### Breaking

- `Resolution` gains a `ViaImport` variant — an exhaustive match will not compile
- Edges land on different nodes, so cached graphs, stored node ids, and
  centrality baselines from 2.6.0 will differ

Call cycles are condensed before PageRank. Each strongly connected component is ranked once and that mass is shared across its members, so a closed ring does not fill the top of the ranking and a cycle that calls out keeps its members together. The number `CentralityScores` reports is still the v2.6.0 percentile, `i / (n - 1)`.

### Known and still open

Written down rather than left to be discovered:

- Small targets now **over**-report (36 → 61, 16 → 46). Safer direction than
  silence, but not yet correct.
- Dynamic and reflective imports (`importlib`, `__import__`, `import()`,
  `eval(require(...))`) are unresolvable by construction and are documented as
  expected misses in the fixture rather than counted as defects.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v2.6.0 — Ground Truth</strong> (colliding symbols kept, deterministic resolution, edge confidence, percentile centrality)</summary>

Correctness, not speed. Each of these was silently wrong before.

| Fix | Why it mattered |
|-----|-----------------|
| **Colliding symbols are kept** | `SymbolTable` used `HashMap::insert`, so a second `handler`, `new`, or `process` replaced the first. The loser had zero callers and was invisible to blast radius. |
| **Resolution is deterministic** | Same-directory locality was decided by iterating a `HashMap`. Rust seeds `RandomState` per process, so the same binary on the same input could build different edges between runs. Now asserted across eight fresh processes. |
| **Edges carry confidence** | A proven same-file call and a same-directory guess were identical evidence. Each edge now scores `[0,1]` by how it resolved. |
| **Exported TS symbols indexed once** | `export_statement` recursed into its children, then the generic loop recursed again — every exported symbol became two vertices sharing one node id. **133 phantom nodes on a 149-file app, 25% of the graph.** |
| **Method calls on untyped receivers resolve** | `obj.method()` was dropped outright, leaving the graph nearly edgeless on TS/JS — and an empty graph reports a blast radius of zero, which reads as "safe" rather than "unknown". |
| **Centrality is a percentile rank** | Scores were divided by the graph maximum, so the top node was `1.0` by construction and a `0.6` threshold meant nothing consistent between repos. Adding one hub rescaled every other node. |
| **Resolution is O(1), not O(refs × nodes × files)** | Unresolvable references — stdlib and third-party calls, most call sites in real code — paid the worst case. Suffixes are now indexed. |

**New capability — concept search.** Substring matching cannot find `get_authenticated` from `login`; they share no substring. Identifiers are now tokenized and expanded through curated concept clusters, and docstrings, signatures, and paths are indexed alongside names. Deterministic, offline, no model. Available on the library as `ArborGraph::search_ranked` (`arbor query` remains literal-substring for now).

**New capability — hunk-level impact.** `changed_node_ids_for_ranges` keeps only symbols whose lines actually changed, instead of every symbol in a touched file.

Measured on identical node sets, after the duplicate-extraction fix:

| Codebase | Before | After |
|----------|--------|-------|
| TypeScript (149 files) | 172 edges | **196** (+14%) |
| Rust (arbor-graph) | 116 edges | **167** (+44%) |

Graph caches from earlier versions are invalidated — centrality now means something different, so a stale cache would be read wrong.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>v2.5.0 — The Last Excuse</strong> (PageRank 23x, parallel indexing, warm-start centrality)</summary>

| Change | Measured |
|--------|----------|
| **PageRank rewrite** — flat call-graph adjacency replaces per-iteration traversal | 149.8ms → **6.6ms** on a 10k-node graph (**23x**), verified side-by-side vs the old implementation |
| **Parallel indexing** — parse fans out across all cores, deterministic assembly | Arbor: 253ms → **95ms** · tokio (178k LOC): 2.7s → **1.6s** |
| **Warm-start centrality** — watcher recomputes seed from previous scores | Converges in ~2 rounds after a one-file patch instead of the full 20-iteration budget |
| **Convergence early-exit** | Iteration stops at 1e-9 max delta — the budget is a ceiling, not a sentence |

Think a number is wrong? `cargo bench -p arbor-graph` and prove it: [BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>v2.4.0 — The Agent-Native Leap</strong> (MCP <code>2026-07-28</code>, HTTP transport, Tasks, MCP Apps)</summary>

| Feature | What it does |
|---------|--------------|
| **MCP `2026-07-28`** | Stateless `server/discover`, response caching (`ttlMs`/`cacheScope`), dual-version fallback for `2025-03-26` clients |
| **Tasks extension** | `tasks/get` · `tasks/update` · `tasks/cancel` — cold-start indexing returns task handles, not errors |
| **MCP Apps** | Interactive blast-radius graph (`ui://arbor/blast-radius`) and architecture map (`ui://arbor/architecture-map`) inside agent hosts |
| **HTTP transport** | `arbor bridge --http --port 3333` — stateless MCP behind load balancers |
| **Real `get_blast_radius`** | Git-diff-aware impact analysis via shared `arbor-graph::compute_blast_radius` |
| **Pagination** | `offset` / `limit` / `hasMore` on `search_symbols` and `get_map` |
| **Benchmarks** | Criterion suite + CI regression gate — see [BENCHMARKS.md](docs/BENCHMARKS.md) |

## Quickstart

```bash
# Install (crates.io can lag the latest release: see docs/INSTALL.md)
cargo install arbor-graph-cli

# Index your project (one command)
cd your-project && arbor setup

# Explore before you edit
arbor map . --exclude-test          # ranked project skeleton (~1k tokens)
arbor refactor parse_file           # blast radius of changing a symbol
arbor diff                          # impact of uncommitted git changes
arbor diff --base origin/main       # impact of this branch, as its PR shows it

# Wire up your AI agent
claude mcp add --transport stdio --scope project arbor -- arbor bridge
```

**After every turn:** `arbor hook claude` makes Claude Code show a receipt of what it changed, what it touched that you didn't ask for, and what to test. [Receipts →](docs/RECEIPTS.md)

**Agent workflow:** call `get_map` first → `search_symbols` / `get_file_graph` to locate code → `Read` only the target file. [Full MCP guide →](docs/MCP_INTEGRATION.md)

## For AI agents (MCP)

Arbor ships a production MCP server via `arbor bridge`. Stdio is the default; HTTP is opt-in for remote/enterprise.

```bash
# Stdio (Claude, Cursor, VS Code)
arbor bridge

# HTTP (MCP 2026-07-28)
arbor bridge --http --port 3333
```

### Cursor / VS Code

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "arbor": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "arbor",
      "args": ["bridge"]
    }
  }
}
```

Templates: [`templates/mcp/`](templates/mcp/) · Setup scripts: `scripts/setup-mcp.sh` · `scripts/setup-mcp.ps1`

### 16 MCP tools

| Tier | Tools | Use when |
|------|-------|----------|
| **Orientation** | `get_map` | First call — token-budgeted project skeleton ranked by PageRank |
| **Surgical** | `list_entry_points` · `get_callers` · `get_callees` · `search_symbols` · `get_file_graph` · `get_node_detail` | Navigate to a specific symbol or file |
| **Broad** | `get_logic_path` · `analyze_impact` · `find_path` · `get_knowledge_path` | Trace dependencies, blast radius, paths |
| **Agent-native** | `get_blast_radius` · `explain_symbol` · `audit_security` · `get_architecture_overview` · `batch_query` | PR impact, onboarding, security audit, bulk lookup |

Every tool returns `{ ok, tool, data, meta: { suggested_next_tool, suggested_next_args } }` so agents chain calls without re-prompting.
